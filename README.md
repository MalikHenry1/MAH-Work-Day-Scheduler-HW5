# MAH-Work-Day-Scheduler-HW5
In this project, I have built a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. The application functions via the user clicking on any given section of time (listed from 9AM to 5PM), adding their desired activity to the schedule, and then clicking the blue save button located at the right end of each time row. 

Upon refreshing the page, the application saves the users previous inputs to the screen using local storage. Each block of time is styled depending on whether it is in the past, present, or future.
